## Target Audience

- TAHelper is specifically designed to assist and help Teaching Assistants (TA) of NUS Computer Science Modules,
which caters to their need to store information in a way that is easy to track and visualise, as well as keep student's
details in a centralised storage. This makes it easy for TAs to disseminate information and reference contact information of their students easily.
Our target audience is specifically only TAs of NUS Computer Science Modules.

[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Assumptions about our Target Audience
1. Firstly, being TAs of a Computer Science (CS) module in NUS, we can safely assume that they have a decent grasp of basic of CLI and
basic software that they have learnt from many of the introductory CS modules they have taken in NUS.
2. Secondly, being well-versed with many technical terms and absorbing large amounts of information through all the modules and studying they have been through,
we can safely assume that most, if not all of our target users will be able to comprehend and familiarise themselves with not only the User Guide but also our TAHelper system.
This essentially allows them to seamlessly integrate themselves with TAHelper and make it user-friendly for them.
3. Thirdly, another assumption made is that each module and tutorial class has its own Excel sheet for student management purposes. This cause information to be sparse and make it slightly more difficult to access.
We can expect that this application will have a higher utility for TAs who teach more than 1 tutorial class as it provides more convenience for communications between students, and handling of administrative tasks.

## Purpose of User Guide
- The purpose of the User Guide (UG) for TAHelper is to provide our target users, TAs of NUS Computer Science modules, with a comprehensive resource that
helps user effectively use and understand our application. In the User Guide, we display clear instructions, a quick start guide, and explanations to help users use TAHelper seamlessly
and effectively. This help users learn the new system in an extremely short timeframe, while allowing them to understand this application deeply, optimise their workflows and improve their
student contact management in the classes they teach.

| STUDENT_ID  | id/          | Follows the format of NUS Student ID that starts with A. Format must be `A`, followed 7 numeric digits, and end off with a alphabetical letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| MODULE      | module/      | Follows the format of NUS CS modules, which starts with either 2 or 3 alphabetical letters, followed by 4 numeric integer between 0-9, and an optional alphabetical letters.<br/> Note: Module codes are case sensitive (must be in all capitals), so `CS2103T` is valid but `cs2103t` is not                                                                                                                                                                         |
| TUTORIAL    | tutorial/    | Follows the format of most NUS tutorial class naming, which starts with 1 alphabetical letter and 2 numeric integers from 0-9. <br/> Note: Tutorial class names are case sensitive (must be a capital letter), so `T09` is valid but `t09` is not.<br/> As of now, tutorial class names with other formats are not accepted.

| TEAM_NAME   | team/        | Alphanumeric characters.<br> As of now, the team related error messages may sometimes add `Team` before the team name, which might lead to confusion. <br> To clarify this, for all purposes, the team name is stored as the exact name you give, and the word `Team` is not appended to it. (e.g. `team/1` is stored as team name `1` and not team name `Team 1`). <br> The actual name of the team is shown in the UI within the tutorial class it was added under. |
| TAG         | tag/         | Tag associated with the student.  Alphanumeric characters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Here are symbols used in the commands:

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `add name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add name/John Doe`.<br><br>

- Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `/add_class module/MODULE tutorial/TUTORIAL [description/DESC] [size/SIZE]` can be used as `/add_class module/CS2103T tutorial/T09`.<br><br>

- Parameters must follow the order specified in the user guide.
  e.g. if the command specifies `name/NAME id/ID', it has to be in this format.<br><br>

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list_student`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `list_student 123`, it will be interpreted as `list_student`. <br><br>

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Adding new tutorial class : `add_class`

Adds a tutorial class with the specified module code and name.

Important Note:
- The team needs to be associated with the tutorial class specified.
- The tutorial class needs to be associated with the module specified.
- As of now, the team related error messages may sometimes add `Team` before the team name, which might lead to confusion. To clarify this, for all purposes, the team name is stored as the exact name you give, and the word `Team` is not appended to it. As such, if you created the team with team name `1`, you need to use `delete_student_from_team` with team name `1` and not `Team 1`.

Expected output:
Upon a successful randomisation, the command will return a confirmation message stating that the students in the specified student has been deleted from the team.

Example: `/delete_student_from_team id/A0123456A module/CS2103T tutorial/T09 team/4`
must be in the team before command execution.
<br>Explanation: This deletes the student with student id `A0123456A` from team `4` of tutorial class `T09` of module `CS2103T`

## FAQ

**Q**: How can I check the Java version on my computer?<br>
**A**: Open your command terminal (refer to [quick start point 4](#quick-start)) if you forgot, and type the following command:<br>
`java -version`

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAHelper home folder. This file will be found in the data folder which you store the `tahelper.jar` at.

**Q**: Will my data be saved when using your app?<br>
**A**: Your data will always be saved in the data folder where you store the `tahelper.jar`. However, be sure to only make changes to the data through `tahelper` itself and do not directly alter the data from the data file.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
