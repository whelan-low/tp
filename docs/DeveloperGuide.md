## **About TA-Helper**

TAs often have difficulties in managing students to teams in their classes, especially if they are managing multiple classes and even modules at the same time. Due to the large number of students, TAs need to track of many nominal rolls for their classes. To effectively manage all students, a TA should have a single platform to keep track of all students, modules and classes taught. Furthermore, students may need to be grouped into various teams for assessment and group project purposes.

TA-Helper is a all-in-one desktop student contact management application for TAs to take control of the trivial student management work so that they can focus on what is most important, teaching and delivering quality content to students!

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `/delete_student index/1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("/delete_student index/1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteClassCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Add student to TAHelper with unique ID or Email

The implemented add mechanism is facilitated by the abstract `AddStudentCommand` along with its specific commands `AddStudentCommand`, as well as the parser `AddStudentCommandParser`.

`AddStudentCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and its relevant operations.

`AddStudentCommand` extends the `Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/add_student name/john email/john@example.com id/A1234567L tags/`

<puml src="diagrams/AddStudentSequence.puml" alt="AddStudentSequence" />
<puml src="diagrams/AddStudentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddStudentSequence" />

Execution steps:
Step 1. The user inputs and executes `/add_student name/john email/john@example.com id/A1234567L tags/` command to add a student with name `john`, along with
a unique email `john@example.com` and unique id `A1234567L`

The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `AddStudentCommandParser` and calls `AddStudentCommandParser#parse()`, with `name/john`, `email/john@example.com`, `id/A1234567L` as the arguments for the function.

Step 3. The `AddStudentCommandParser` parses the arguments and get the values of the user input associated with the prefixes, from there determine the name, email and id of the student to add.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** All fields must be specified. There must be a valid value for name, email and id.
Additionally, email and id must be unique compared to the values already present in the system to get achieve a successful add.
Tags here are optional and need not be specified.

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefixes, `AddStudentCommandParser` creates an `AddStudentCommand` object. Each command contains all the required prefixes and values to used to create the command object.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `AddStudentCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the student to add to the TAHelper system.
Throughout the process, error handling (e.g checking for duplicate email or id, making sure references passed are not null) is utilised to mitigate potential errors and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the student is added to the TAHelper system.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A unique email and id is required when adding students into the TAHelper system, as well as user have to specify all fields, name, email and id in order to add a new student successfully.
  - Pros: Ensures that all students can be identified in 2 ways, email and id. This helps facilitate other commands such as search and add student to classes as checking the email or id for those commands checks the whole system to find a match, rather than a subset of the system.
  - Cons: An individual, at least in the context of NUS, can be uniquely identified by either their email E....@u.nus.edu, or by their Student ID. Therefore, specifying both may not be required and may cause extra work.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow user to specify more information about themselves such as year of study, course of study, just to name a few. This way we can support even more commands that searches say based on course of study, year of study etc.
  - Pros: Search, add, delete, sort commands all can become more specific, and the commands can make use of more information to achieve its desired outcome as well, instead of solely relying on email or id, which although present in the system, may not be readily available or easily remembered by the users themselves.
  - Cons: The addition of these fields to the system could lead to increase complexity of the codebase and increased coupling between components in the codebase. This will make the codebase harder to debug and maintain. Also, these field possibly being optional may lead to an increase in the number of null values and thus null checks in the system, which can make the codes in the codebase harder to reason about and refactor in the future.

### \[Implemented\] Delete student

The implemented add mechanism is facilitated by the abstract `DeleteStudentCommand` along with its specific commands `DeleteStudentByEmailCommand`, `DeleteStudentByIdCommand` and `DeleteStudentClassByIndexCommand`, as well as the parser `DeleteStudentCommandParser`.

`DeleteStudentCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and its operations.

`DeleteStudentCommand` extends the `Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism, such as retrieving the target tutorial class. Each of the following commands further extends `DeleteStudentCommand` based on its specific functionality:

- `DeleteStudentByEmailCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Delete student based on specified email.
- `DeleteStudentByIdCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Delete student based on specified student id.
- `DeleteStudentByIndexCommand`â€‰â€” Delete student based on specifiedâ€‰index (viewable from the UI).

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.
Format: `/delete_student [id/ID] [email/EMAIL] [index/INDEX]`
*Only 1 of the 3 parameters (id, email, index) must be specified
Example: `/delete_student id/A0123456X`

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteStudentSequence.puml" alt="DeleteStudentSequence" />

Step 1. The user executes `/delete_student id/A0123456X` command to delete the particular student with id `A0123456X`.
The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `DeleteStudentCommandParser` and calls `DeleteStudentCommandParser#parse()`, with `id/A0123456X` as the argument.

Step 3. The `DeleteStudentCommandParser` parses the arguments to determine what parameter is used to specify the target student (email, index or id).

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** The id/email/index must be specified. To determine the target student, only one prefix should used per command. If there are multiple prefixes, the target priority is as follows: By Index -> By Student ID -> By Email

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefix used, `DeleteStudentCommandParser` creates the specific `DeleteStudentCommand` accordingly. Each command contains a specific predicate to find the student.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteStudentCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the student to delete using the defined predicate. Throughout the process, error handling (e.g checking for invalid student) is utilised to mitigate potential discrepancies and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the student is deleted.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Seperate each specific command into a different class, while overlapping code is abstracted to an abstract class.
  - Pros: Specific commands are instantiated and thus can be easily traced and is more readable. Any reusable code is defined in the abstract class which can then be reused by the subclasses.
  - Cons: May have duplicate code to a certain extent.

* **Alternative 2:** Lump into one generic command that handles each parameter accordingly.
  - Pros: Reduces duplicate code and much cleaner (i.e only 1 command class is executed).
  - Cons: The logic handling may be slightly more complex and messy within the class as all parameters have to be dealt with seperately (potentially using different logic).

### \[Implemented\] Edit student

The implemented edit mechanism is facilitated by the `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser`. `EditCommand` extends the
`Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that support the mechanism, such as creating the edited person to replace
the target. `EditCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and its operations.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/edit_student index/1 id/A1234567L`

<puml src="diagrams/EditStudentSequence.puml" alt="EditStudentSequence" />

Step 1. The user executes `/edit_student index/1 id/A1234567L` command to edit the first student's id. The command calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `EditCommandParser` and calls `EditCommandParser#parse()`,
with `index/1 id/A1234567L` as the arguments.

Step 3. The `EditCommandParser` parses the arguments to determine which target student and parameter is being edited.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** At least one of the parameters must be present for the command to successfully return.

</box>

Step 4. `EditCommandParser` creates an `EditPersonDescriptor`, and sets the values to be edited. An `EditCommand` is created,
passing the `EditPersonDescriptor` as an argument.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `EditCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method creates an `editedPerson`,
with all the edited information.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** Throughout the process, the method checks for duplicate persons in the Address Book. This
refers to either same person, person with same email or person with same id.

</box>

Step 6. Finally, the method calls `Model#setPerson`, which replaces the target person with the edited person, and `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`
to update the list with the new information. A `CommandResult` is created, informing of successful execution.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** Currently, edited student information only displays on the list it was edited in. The edited details
are not propagated to other lists (students in different class/modules). More information can be found in the [planned
enhancements](#appendix-planned-enhancements) section.

</box>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Lump into one generic command that handles each parameter accordingly.

  - Pros: Reduces duplicate code and much cleaner (i.e only 1 command class is executed).
  - Cons: The logic handling may be slightly more complex and messy within the class as all parameters have to be dealt with seperately (potentially using different logic). Since the scale of the command is relatively small, we have opted for this implementation to keep things simple.

- **Alternative 2:** Separate each specific command into a different class, while overlapping code is abstracted to an abstract class.
  - Pros: Specific commands are instantiated and thus can be easily traced and is more readable. Any reusable code is defined in the abstract class which can then be reused by the subclasses.
  - Cons: May have duplicate code to a certain extent.

### \[Implemented\] Add student to tutorial class

The implemented add mechanism is facilitated by the abstract `AddStudentToClassCommand` along with its specific commands `AddStudentToClassByEmailCommand`, `AddStudentToClassByIdCommand` and `AddStudentToClassByIndexCommand`, as well as the parser `AddStudentToClassCommandParser`.

`AddStudentToClassCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and its operations.

`AddStudentToClassCommand` extends the `Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism, such as retrieving the target tutorial class. Each of the following commands further extends `AddStudentToClassCommand` based on its specific functionality:

- `AddStudentToClassByEmailCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Add student based on specified email to a tutorial class.
- `AddStudentToClassByIdCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Add student based on specified student ID to a tutorial class.
- `AddStudentToClassByIndexCommand`â€‰â€” Add student based on specifiedâ€‰index (viewable from the UI) to a tutorial class

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step. <br>
Format: `/add_student_to_class [id/ID] [email/EMAIL] [index/INDEX] module/MODULE tutorial/TUTORIAL`
\*Only 1 of the 3 optional parameters (id, email, index) must be specified
Example: `/add_student_to_class id/A0123456X module/CS2103T tutorial/T09`

<puml src="diagrams/AddStudentToClassSequence.puml" alt="AddStudentToClassSequence" />

Step 1. The user executes `/add_student_to_class id/A01234567X module/CS2103T tutorial/T09` command to add the particular student with id `A01234567X` to the module `CS2103T` and tutorial class `T09`.
The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `AddStudentToClassCommandParser` and calls `AddStudentToClassCommandParser#parse()`, with `id/A01234567X`, `module/CS2103T` and `tutorial/T09` as the arguments.

Step 3. The `AddStudentToClassCommandParser` parses the arguments to determine what parameter is used to specify the target student (email, index or id). Additionally, the `ModuleCode` and `TutorialClass` is determined.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** The tutorial class and module code must be specified. To determine the target student, only one prefix should used per command. If there are multiple prefixes, the target priority is as follows: By Index -> By Student ID -> By Email

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefix used, `AddStudentToClassCommandParser` creates the specific `AddStudentToClassCommand` accordingly. Each command contains a specific predicate to find the student.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `AddStudentToClassCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the target module and tutorial class. Then, the method retrieves the student to add using the defined predicate. Throughout the process, error handling (e.g checking for invalid student/module/tutorial) is utilised to mitigate potential discrepancies and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the student is added to the tutorial class.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Seperate each specific command into a different class, while overlapping code is abstracted to an abstract class.
  - Pros: Specific commands are instantiated and thus can be easily traced and is more readable. Any reusable code is defined in the abstract class which can then be reused by the subclasses.
  - Cons: May have duplicate code to a certain extent.

* **Alternative 2:** Lump into one generic command that handles each parameter accordingly.
  - Pros: Reduces duplicate code and much cleaner (i.e only 1 command class is executed).
  - Cons: The logic handling may be slightly more complex and messy within the class as all parameters have to be dealt with seperately (potentially using different logic).

### \[Implemented\] Delete student from class

The implemented add mechanism is facilitated by the abstract `DeleteStudentFromClassCommand` along with its specific commands `DeleteStudentFromClassByEmailCommand`, `DeleteStudentFromClassByIdCommand` and `DeleteStudentFromClassByIndexCommand`, as well as the parser `DeleteStudentFromClassCommandParser`.

`DeleteStudentFromClassCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and its operations.

`DeleteStudentFromClassCommand` extends the `Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism, such as retrieving the target tutorial class. Each of the following commands further extends `DeleteStudentCommand` based on its specific functionality:

- `DeleteStudentFromClassByEmailCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Delete student based on specified email from a tutorial class.
- `DeleteStudentFromClassByIdCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Delete student based on specified student id from a tutorial class.
- `DeleteStudentByIndexCommand`â€‰â€” Delete student based on specifiedâ€‰index (viewable from the UI) from a tutorial class

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/delete_student_from_class id/A01234567X module/CS2103T tutorial/T09`

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteStudentFromClassSequence.puml" alt="DeleteStudentFromClassSequence" />

Step 1. The user executes `/delete_student_from_class id/A01234567X module/CS2103T tutorial/T09` command to delete the particular student with id `A01234567X` from the module `CS2103T` and tutorial class `T09`.
The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `DeleteStudentFromClassCommandParser` and calls `DeleteStudentFromClassCommandParser#parse()`, with `id/A01234567X`, `module/CS2103T` and `tutorial/T09` as the arguments.

Step 3. The `DeleteStudentFromClassCommandParser` parses the arguments to determine what parameter is used to specify the target student (email, index or id). Additionally, the `ModuleCode` and `TutorialClass` is determined.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** The tutorial class and module code must be specified. To determine the target student, only one prefix should be used per command. If there are multiple prefixes, the target priority is as follows: By Index -> By Student ID -> By Email

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteStudentFromClassCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the target module and tutorial class. Then, the method retrieves the student to delete using the defined predicate. Throughout the process, error handling (e.g checking for invalid student/module/tutorial) is utilised to mitigate potential discrepancies and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the student is deleted from the tutorial class.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Seperate each specific command into a different class, while overlapping code is abstracted to an abstract class.
  - Pros: Specific commands are instantiated and thus can be easily traced and is more readable. Any reusable code is defined in the abstract class which can then be reused by the subclasses.
  - Cons: May have duplicate code to a certain extent.

  - Pros: Reduces duplicate code and much cleaner (i.e only 1 command class is executed).
  - Cons: The logic handling may be slightly more complex and messy within the class as all parameters have to be dealt with seperately (potentially using different logic).

### \[Implemented\] List students of class

The implementation of adding a class is facilitated by the `ListStudentsOfClassCommand` and `ListStudentsOfClassCommandParser`. `ListStudentsOfClassCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `ListStudentsOfClassCommand` extends the
`Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/class_list_students module/CS2103T tutorial/T09`

<puml src="diagrams/ListStudentsOfClass.puml" alt="ListStudentsOfClass" />

Execution steps:
Step 1. The user inputs and executes `/class_list_students module/CS2103T tutorial/T09` command to list students of the unique tutorial `T09` of a module `CS2103T`.

The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `ListStudentsOfClassCommandParser` and calls `ListStudentsOfClassCommandParser#parse()`, with `module/CS2103T`, `tutorial/T09` as the arguments for the function.

Step 3. The `ListStudentsOfClassCommandParser` parses the arguments and get the values of the user input associated with the prefixes, from there determine the students to display to the user.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** All fields must be specified. There must be a valid value for module and tutorial.
Additionally, module and tutorial must match with one of the values already present in the system to get achieve a successful listing.
Tags here are optional and need not be specified.

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefixes, `ListStudentsOfClassCommandParser` creates an `ListStudentsOfClassCommand` object. Each command contains all the required prefixes and values to used to create the command object.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `ListStudentsOfClassCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the module and tutorial class.
Throughout the process, error handling (e.g making sure references passed are not null) is utilised to mitigate potential errors and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the students of a particular tutorial class of a module is listed.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Lists all students with their tutorial classes and modules in the result display panel.
  - Pros: Ensures that all students are displayed correctly.
  - Cons: Users may want to view all the student of a certain module but are unable to do so.

### \[Implemented\] Search for students

The implemented search mechanism is facilitated by `SearchStudentCommand` and `SearchStudentCommandParser`.
`SearchStudentCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `SearchStudentCommand` extends the
`Command` class with the ability to update `Model`'s filtered person list using `Predicate`. It supports the following
`Predicate`:

- `NameContainsKeywordPredicate`â€‰â€”â€‰Search students based on name.
- `EmailContainsKeywordPredicate`â€‰â€”â€‰Search students based on email.
- `StudentIdContainsKeywordPredicate`â€‰â€”â€‰Search students based on student id.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/search_student name/Bob`

<puml src="diagrams/SearchStudentSequence.puml" alt="SearchStudentSequence" />

Step 1. The user executes `/search_student name/Bob` command to find students with the keyword `Bob` in their name.
The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the
arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `SearchStudentCommandParser` and calling
`SearchStudentCommandParser#parse()`, with `name/Bob` as the argument.

Step 3. The `SearchStudentCommandParser` parses the arguments to determine which prefix the user is searching in.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Only one prefix can be used per command. If there are multiple prefixes, the method will throw an exception.

</box>

Step 4. `SearchStudentCommandParser` creates `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` and `SearchStudentCommand`, passing the predicate
as an argument into the command.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `SearchStudentCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method calls
`Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` with the given predicate, updating the filtered list in `Model` with students whose
name contains `Bob`.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the new filtered is displayed to the user.

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only one prefix allowed per command.
  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: Does not allow users to fine tune searches based on multiple fields.
- **Alternative 2:** Allow for multiple prefixes.
  - Pros: Users can filter searches to a higher degree
  - Cons: Handling combinations of different fields could be complex

### \[Implemented\] Sort students

The implemented search mechanism is facilitated by `SortStudentCommand` and `SortStudentCommandParser`.
`SortStudentCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `SortStudentCommand` extends the
`Command` class with the ability to update `Model`'s person list. `SortStudentCommand` supports the enumerations found
within `SortStudentParameter`.

**Note:** Unlike other commands that modify the current displayed person list using `Predicate`, `SortStudentCommand`
calls `Model#getSortedPersonList()`, which returns a copy of the `UniquePersonList` that can be sorted using
comparators.

The following are the current parameters that are supported with `SortStudentCommand`.

- `name`â€‰â€”â€‰Sort students based on name.
- `email`â€‰â€”â€‰Sort students based on email.
- `id`â€‰â€”â€‰Sort students based on student id.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/sort_student by/id`

<puml src="diagrams/SortStudentSequence.puml" alt="SortStudentSequence" />

Step 1. The user executes `/sort_student by/id` command to sort student based on the value of their id.
The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the
arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `SortStudentCommandParser` and calling
`SortStudentCommandParser#parse()`, with `by/id` as the argument.

Step 3. The `SortStudentCommandParser` parses the arguments to determine which prefix the user is searching in.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Only one input: name or email or id can be used per command. If there are multiple inputs, the method will throw an exception.

</box>

Step 4. `id` is parsed by `SortStudentCommandParser`, returning a `SortStudentParameter`. `SortStudentCommandParser`
creates `SortStudentCommand` and passes the new parameter as an argument.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `SortStudentCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. A `Comparator` is created, passing a
function that compares by `id` as an argument. The execute method then calls `AddressBook#getSortedPersonList()` with the
given comparator, returning the sorted list in `AddressBook` with the sorted order of the students.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the sorted list of students is displayed to the user.

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only one prefix allowed per command.
  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: Does not allow users to fine tune searches based on multiple fields.
- **Alternative 2:** Allow for multiple prefixes.
  - Pros: Users can filter searches to a higher degree
  - Cons: Handling combinations of different fields could be complex

### \[Implemented\] Add class

The implementation of adding a class is facilitated by the `AddClassCommand` and `AddClassCommandParser`. `AddClassCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `AddClassCommand` extends the
`Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/add_class module/CS2103T tutorial/T09`

<puml src="diagrams/AddClassSequence.puml" alt="AddClassSequence" />

Execution steps:
Step 1. The user inputs and executes `/add_class module/CS2103T tutorial/T09` command to add a module `CS2103T`, along with
a unique tutorial `T09`

The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `AddClassCommandParser` and calls `AddClassCommandParser#parse()`, with `module/CS2103T`, `tutorial/T09` as the arguments for the function.

Step 3. The `AddClassCommandParser` parses the arguments and get the values of the user input associated with the prefixes, from there determine the tutorial of the module to add.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** All fields must be specified. There must be a valid value for module and tutorial.
Additionally, module and tutorial must be unique compared to the values already present in the system to get achieve a successful add.
Tags here are optional and need not be specified.

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefixes, `AddClassCommandParser` creates an `AddClassCommand` object. Each command contains all the required prefixes and values to used to create the command object.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `AddClassCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the class to add to the system.
Throughout the process, error handling (e.g checking for duplicate module code or tutorial, making sure references passed are not null) is utilised to mitigate potential errors and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the class is added to the TAHelper system.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A unique module code and tutorial class is required when adding classes into the TAHelper system, as well as user have to specify all fields, module code and tutorial class in order to add a new class successfully.
  - Pros: Ensures that all classes are unique and not repeated. This helps facilitate other commands such as add student to classes to find a match in class easily without duplicates.
  - Cons: Users may inadvertently provide incorrect or non-existent module codes or tutorial class identifiers, leading to errors in the system. This could result in frustration and a poor user experience.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow user to specify only the module code when adding classes
  - Pros: Users can add classes without needing to specify the tutorial class immediately, allowing for greater flexibility in the workflow. They can add the class first and then specify the tutorial class later, as needed. The input process is also streamlined, reducing the burden on users. This simplicity can lead to faster data entry and a more intuitive user experience.
  - Cons: Users may inadvertently create duplicate classes if they do not specify the tutorial class identifier accurately or if they forget to add it later. This could result in redundancy and inconsistencies within the system.

### \[Implemented\] Delete class

The implementation of adding a class is facilitated by the `DeleteClassCommand` and `DeleteClassCommandParser`. `DeleteClassCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `DeleteClassCommand` extends the
`Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/delete_class module/CS2103T tutorial/T09`

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteClassSequence.puml" alt="DeleteClassSequence" />

Execution steps:
Step 1. The user inputs and executes `/delete_class module/CS2103T tutorial/T09` command to delete a module `CS2103T`, along with
a unique tutorial `T09`

The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `DeleteClassCommandParser` and calls `DeleteClassCommandParser#parse()`, with `module/CS2103T`, `tutorial/T09` as the arguments for the function.

Step 3. The `DeleteClassCommandParser` parses the arguments and get the values of the user input associated with the prefixes, from there determine the tutorial of the module to delete.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** All fields must be specified. There must be a valid value for module and tutorial.
Additionally, module and tutorial must match with one of the values already present in the system to get achieve a successful delete.
Tags here are optional and need not be specified.

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefixes, `DeleteClassCommandParser` creates an `DeleteClassCommand` object. Each command contains all the required prefixes and values to used to create the command object.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteClassCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the class to delete from the system.
Throughout the process, error handling (e.g making sure references passed are not null) is utilised to mitigate potential errors and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the class is deleted from the module in the TAHelper system.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A unique module code and tutorial class is required when deleting classes from the TAHelper system, as well as user have to specify all fields, module code and tutorial class in order to delete a new class successfully.
  - Pros: Ensures that the class is only deleted if there is a match in the system. Also ensure that the other tutorial classes of the module is not deleted if no tutorial class is specified.
  - Cons: Users may inadvertently provide incorrect or non-existent module codes or tutorial class identifiers, leading to errors in the system. This could result in frustration and a poor user experience.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow user the option to delete the entire module without specifying the tutorial class.

  - Pros: Users can delete modules without needing to specify the tutorial class, allowing for greater ease in the workflow. This allows users who are no longer teaching the module to remove all the information with one command.
  - Cons: Users may accidentally delete the entire module if they forgot to specify the tutorial class identifier and this may lead to great data damage. A separate command to delete module would be better.

* **Alternative 3:** Allow user the option to delete all classes in the module without specifying the tutorial class.
  - Pros: Users can delete modules without needing to specify the tutorial class, allowing for greater ease in the workflow. This allows users who are no longer teaching the module to remove all the information with one command.
  - Cons: Users may accidentally delete all tutorial classes if they forgot to specify the tutorial class identifier and this may lead to great data damage. A separate command to delete all classes would be better.

### \[Implemented\] Delete module

The implementation of adding a class is facilitated by the `DeleteModuleCommand` and `DeletModuleCommandParser`. `DeleteModuleCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `DeleteModuleCommand` extends the
`Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/delete_module module/CS2103T`

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteModuleSequence.puml" alt="DeleteModuleSequence" />

Execution steps:
Step 1. The user inputs and executes `/delete_module module/CS2103T` command to delete a module `CS2103T`.

The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `DeleteModuleCommandParser` and calls `DeleteModuleCommandParser#parse()`, with `module/CS2103T` as the argument for the function.

Step 3. The `DeleteModuleCommandParser` parses the arguments and get the values of the user input associated with the prefixes, from there determine the module to delete.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** All fields must be specified. There must be a valid value for module.
Additionally, module must match with one of the values already present in the system to get achieve a successful delete.
Tags here are optional and need not be specified.

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefixes, `DeleteModuleCommandParser` creates an `DeleteModuleCommand` object. Each command contains all the required prefixes and values to used to create the command object.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteModuleCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the module to delete from the TAHelper system.
Throughout the process, error handling (e.g making sure references passed are not null) is utilised to mitigate potential errors and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the module is deleted from the TAHelper system.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A unique module code is required when deleting modules from the TAHelper system.
  - Pros: Ensures that the class is only deleted if there is a match in the system.
  - Cons: Users may accidentally use this command instead of `/delete_class`. This will result in huge data loss.

### \[Implemented\] List class

The implementation of adding a class is facilitated by the `ListClassCommand` and `ListClassCommandParser`. `ListClassCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `ListClassCommand` extends the
`Command` class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/List_class`

<puml src="diagrams/ListClassSequence.puml" alt="ListClassSequence" />

Execution steps:
Step 1. The user inputs and executes `/list_class` command to list all the class available.

The `execute` initiates the execution of the command by directly accessing the model. It begins by ensuring that the model contains data, specifically a list of modules. If the list is empty, it returns a message indicating there are no modules.

Step 2. It then iterates through each module, appending its string representation followed by a colon. Within each module iteration, it iterates through its tutorial classes, appending their string representations separated by commas.

Step 3. The result string is then trimmed and `CommandResult`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Lists all modules and their tutorial classes in the result display panel.
  - Pros: Ensures that all classes are displayed correctly.
  - Cons: Users may want to view tutorial classes of certain modules only but are unable to do so.

### \[Implemented\] Add team

The implementation of adding a class is facilitated by the `AddTeamCommand` and `AddTeamCommandParser`. `AddTeamCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `AddTeamCommand` extends the
`Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step. <br>
Format: `/add_team module/MODULE tutorial/TUTORIAL team/TEAM_NAME [size/SIZE]`
Example: `/add_team module/CS2103 tutorial/T09 team/Team 1 size/5`

<puml src="diagrams/AddTeamSequence.puml" alt="AddTeamSequence" />

Execution steps:
Step 1. The user inputs and executes `/add_team module/CS2103 tutorial/T09 team/Team 1 size/5` command to add a team `Team 1` of size `5` to the tutorial class `T09` of module `CS2103T`

The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `AddTeamCommandParser` and calls `AddTeamCommandParser#parse()`, with `team/Team 1`, `size/5`, `module/CS2103T`, `tutorial/T09` as the arguments for the function.

Step 3. The `AddTeamCommandParser` parses the arguments and get the values of the user input associated with the prefixes, from there determine the team to add.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** Team name, module and tutorial must be specified with valid values. Size is an optional parameter. If size is not specified, the default size of the team is set to `INTEGER.MAX_VALUE`.

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefixes, `AddTeamCommandParser` creates an `AddTeamCommand` object. Each command contains all the required prefixes and values to used to create the command object.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `AddTeamCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. Within the execution process, the method retrieves the module and tutorial from the model. Within the tutorial, the method checks if a team with the same name exists. If such a team already exists, the method will return an error.

**Important Note:** Two teams are considered equal if and only if they have the same team name and belong to the same tutorial class, irregardless of size.

Throughout the process, error handling (e.g checking for valid module and tutorial class, making sure references passed are not null) is utilised to mitigate potential errors and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the team is added to the tutorial class specified.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Robustness:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using `null` to represent an optional team size cand tutorial class is required when adding classes into the TAHelper system, as well as user have to specify all fields, team name, module code and tutorial class in order to add a new team successfully.
  - Pros: Ensures that all teams are unique and not repeated. This helps facilitate other commands such as allocate student to teams to find a match in team easily without duplicates.
  - Cons: Users may inadvertently provide incorrect or non-existent module codes or tutorial class identifiers, leading to errors in the system. This could result in frustration and a poor user experience.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow user to not specify team size when adding teams
  - Pros: Users can add teams without needing to specify the team size immediately, allowing for greater flexibility in the workflow. They can add the team first and then specify the team size later, as needed. The input process is also streamlined, reducing the burden on users. This simplicity can lead to faster data entry and a more intuitive user experience.
  - Cons: Users may inadvertently add too many students to the team if they do not specify the team size identifier accurately or if they forget to add it later. This could result in errors within the system.

### \[Implemented\] Delete team

The implementation of adding a class is facilitated by the `DeleteTeamCommand` and `DeleteTeamCommandParser`. `DeleteTeamCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `DeleteTeamCommand` extends the
`Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.
Format: `/delete_team module/MODULE tutorial/TUTORIAL team/TEAM_NAME`
Example: `/delete_team module/CS2103T tutorial/T09 team/Team 1`

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteTeamSequence.puml" alt="DeleteTeamSequence" />

Execution steps:
Step 1. The user inputs and executes `/delete_team module/CS2103T tutorial/T09 team/Team 1` command to delete a team `Team 1` in tutorial `T09` of module `CS2103T`.

The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `DeleteTeamCommandParser` and calls `DeleteTeamCommandParser#parse()`, with `team/Team 1`, `module/CS2103T`, `tutorial/T09` as the arguments for the function.

Step 3. The `DeleteTeamCommandParser` parses the arguments and get the values of the user input associated with the prefixes, from there determine the tutorial of the module to delete.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** All fields must be specified. There must be a valid value for module, tutorial and team, which must match with one of the values already present in the system to get achieve a successful delete.
Additionally, two teams are considered equal if and only if they have the same team name and belong to the same tutorial class, irregardless of size.

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefixes, `DeleteTeamCommandParser` creates an `DeleteTeamCommand` object. Each command contains all the required prefixes and values to used to create the command object.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteTeamCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. Within the execution process, the method retrieves the module and tutorial from the model. Thereafter, it retrieves the team from the tutorial class.
Throughout the process, error handling (e.g checking for valid module, tutorial and team, making sure references passed are not null) is utilised to mitigate potential errors and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the team is deleted from the TAHelper system.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Functionality:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Team size is not included in equality check of teams.

  - Pros:
    - **Simplification of team identity**: Excluding team size simplifies the concept of what defines a team, making it easier to manage teams, especially if the team size changes. In most cases, team size is less relevant to its identity and more about its functional role or participation
  - Cons:
    - **Potential for ambiguity/Inaccurate representation**: Not considering team size might lead to situations where teams with the same name but of different sizes are treated the same, which can cause issues in contexts where size is a significant factor. However, this is mitigated by also including tutorial class in the equality check (i.e there can be multiple teams of the same name within the system as long as they are in different tutorials)

- **Alternative 2 :** Team size is included in equality check of teams.
  - Pros:
    - **Precision**: Including team size allows the system to distinguish between teams more precisely.
    - **Data integrity**: This method can prevent confusion or errors in operations where the specific composition of the team (including its size) is crucial, especially for future enhancements such as scheduling.
  - Cons:
    - **Complexity in team management**: might complicate the management of teams, especially in dynamic settings where team sizes can fluctuate. Changes in team size would necessitate creating a new team or redefining the team entity.

### \[Implemented\] Allocate student to team

The implemented allocate mechanism is facilitated by the common class `AllocateStudentToTeamCommand` along with its specific commands `AllocateStudentToTeamByEmailCommand`, `AllocateStudentToTeamByIdCommand` and `AllocateStudentToTeamByIndexCommand`, as well as the parser `AllocateStudentToTeamCommandParser`.

`AllocateStudentToTeamCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and its operations.

`AllocateStudentToTeamCommand` extends the `Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism, such as retrieving the target tutorial class. Each of the following commands further extends `AllocateStudentToTeamCommand` based on its specific functionality:

- `AllocateStudentToTeamByEmailCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Allocate student based on specified email to a team.
- `AllocateStudentToTeamByIdCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Allocate student based on specified student ID to a team.
- `AllocateStudentToTeamByIndexCommand`â€‰â€” Allocate student based on specifiedâ€‰index (viewable from the UI) to a team.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.<br>

Format: `/allocate_team [id/ID] [email/EMAIL] [index/INDEX] module/MODULE tutorial/TUTORIAL team/TEAMNAME`
\*Only 1 of the 3 optional parameters (id, email, index) must be specified.

Example: `/allocate_team id/A0123456X module/CS2103T tutorial/T09 team/Team 1`

<puml src="diagrams/AllocateStudentToTeamSequence.puml" alt="AllocateStudentToTeamSequence" />

Step 1. The user executes `/allocate_team id/A0123456X module/CS2103T tutorial/T09 team/Team 1` command to add the particular student with ID `A0123456X` to team `Team 1` in the tutorial class `T09` of module `CS2103T`.
The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `AllocateStudentToTeamCommandParser` and calls `AllocateStudentToTeamCommandParser#parse()`, with `id/A01234567X`, `module/CS2103T`, `tutorial/T09` and `team/Team 1` as the arguments.

Step 3. The `AllocateStudentToTeamCommandParser` parses the arguments to determine what parameter is used to specify the target student (email, index or id). Additionally, the `TutorialTeam`, `ModuleCode` and `TutorialClass` are determined.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** The team, tutorial class and module code must be specified. To determine the target student, only one prefix should be used per command. If there are multiple prefixes, the target priority is as follows: By Student ID -> By Email -> By Index

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefix used, `AllocateStudentToTeamCommandParser` creates the specific `AllocateStudentToTeamCommand` accordingly. Each command contains the information it needs to add the target student into a tutorial team.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `AllocateStudentToTeamCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the target module and tutorial class. Then, the method retrieves the student to add using the defined value. Throughout the process, error handling (e.g checking for invalid student/module/tutorial/team) is utilised to mitigate potential discrepancies and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the student is added to the tutorial team.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate each specific command into a different class, while overlapping code is abstracted to a common class in which the different classes can extend from.
  - Pros: Specific commands are instantiated and thus can be easily traced and is more readable. Any reusable code is defined in the common class which can then be reused by the subclasses. Logic of the program is also more well-defined and behaviours related to one form of allocate command can be grouped together.
  - Cons: May have duplicate code to a certain extent.

* **Alternative 2:** Lump into one generic command that handles each parameter accordingly.
  - Pros: Reduces duplicate code and slightly cleaner to a certain extent. (i.e only 1 command class is executed).
  - Cons: The logic handling may be slightly more complex and messy within the class as all parameters have to be dealt with separately (potentially using different logic).

### \[Implemented\] Randomly allocate students to teams in tutorial class

The implemented random allocation mechanism is facilitated by the class `RandomTeamAllocationCommand`, as well as the parser `RandomTeamAllocationCommandParser`.

`RandomTeamAllocationCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and its operations.

`RandomTeamAllocationCommand` extends the `Command` class and contains auxiliary operations that supports the mechanism, such as retrieving the target tutorial class.

Format: `/random_teams module/MODULE tutorial/TUTORIAL teams/NUMBER_OF_TEAMS`

Example: `/random_teams module/CS2103T tutorial/T09 teams/2`

Step 1. The user executes `/random_teams module/CS2103T tutorial/T09 teams/2` command to randomly allocate the students in tutorial class `T09` of module `CS2103T` into `2` different teams.
The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `RandomTeamAllocationCommandParser` and calls `RandomTeamAllocationCommandParser#parse()`, with `module/CS2103T`, `tutorial/T09` and `teams/2` as the arguments.

Step 3. The `RandomTeamAllocationCommandParser` parses the arguments to determine the parameters based on the user input. The `ModuleCode`, `TutorialClass` and `NumberOfTeams` are determined.

<box type="info" seamless></box>

Step 4. Based on the prefix given, `RandomTeamAllocationCommandParser` creates a new `RandomTeamAllocationCommand` accordingly. Each command contains the information it needs to randomly allocate all the students in the tutorial class into different teams.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `RandomTeamAllocationCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the target module and tutorial class. Then, the method retrieves the number of teams to split the list of students into. Throughout the process, error handling (e.g checking for invalid module/tutorial/number) is utilised to mitigate potential discrepancies and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the list of students in the tutorial class is randomly allocated into the number of teams specified.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Functionality:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Randomly allocates the list of students into different teams, and delete all the current existing teams in the tutorial class first before doing the allocation.

  - Pros:
    - **Allocation is not hindered by existing teams**: Existing teams being present in the tutorial class will not cause incorrect allocation of students, and ensure all students get allocated properly.
  - Cons:
    - **Potential Data Loss**: Teams can be formed for various purposes and may not only have 1 set of teams. Deleting all existing teams before randomly allocating can cause data from the other teams, used for other purpose, to be lost.

- **Alternative 2 :** Does not delete all existing teams in the tutorial class. Instead, each time the random allocation command is run, a new set of teams is created, and stored in the tutorial class.
  - Pros:
    - **No assumptions made**: The command does not make any assumptions about the purpose of the existing teams in the tutorial class.
  - Cons:
    - **Complexity in implementation**: This implementation may be very complex and difficult to implement. Furthermore, if not done well, it can lead to a lot of bugs.

### \[Implemented\] View team

The implementation of viewing a team is facilitated by the `ViewTeamCommand` and `ViewTeamCommandParser`. `ViewTeamCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and it's operations. `ViewTeamCommand` extends the
`Command` class and displays team information based on the parameter of team passed in. It supports the following `Parameters`:

- `Name`â€‰â€”â€‰Search and display team information based on team name.
- `Index`â€‰â€”â€‰Search and display team information based on index of team in the tutorial class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/view_teams name/Team 1 module/CS2103T tutorial/T09`

<puml src="diagrams/ViewTeamSequence.puml" alt="ViewTeamSequence" />

Execution steps:
Step 1. The user inputs and executes `/view_teams name/Team 1 module/CS2103T tutorial/T09` command to view team `Team 1` of the tutorial class `T09` in module `CS2103T`.

The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `ViewTeamCommandParser` and calls `ViewTeamCommandParser#parse()`, with `name/Team 1`, `module/CS2103T`, `tutorial/T09` as the arguments for the function.

Step 3. The `ViewTeamCommandParser` parses the arguments and get the values of the user input associated with the prefixes, from there determine the team to add.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** All fields must be specified. There must be a valid value for name, module and tutorial.
Tags here are optional and need not be specified.

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefixes, `ViewTeamCommandParser` creates an `ViewTeamCommand` object. Each command contains all the required prefixes and values to used to create the command object.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `ViewTeamCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the target team in the tutorial class of the module.
Throughout the process, error handling (e.g making sure references passed are not null) is utilised to mitigate potential errors and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the information of the team is displayed.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

### \[Implemented\] Delete student from team

The implemented add mechanism is facilitated by the abstract `DeleteStudentFromTeamCommand` along with its specific commands `DeleteStudentFromTeamByEmailCommand`, `DeleteStudentFromClassByIdCommand` and `DeleteStudentFromTeamByIndexCommand`, as well as the parser `DeleteStudentFromTeamCommandParser`.

`DeleteStudentFromTeamCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and its operations.

`DeleteStudentFromTeamCommand` extends the `Command` class and contains auxillary operations that supports the mechanism, such as retrieving the target tutorial team. Each of the following commands further extends `DeleteStudentFromTeamCommand` based on its specific functionality:

- `DeleteStudentFromTeamByEmailCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Delete student from team based on specified email from a tutorial team.
- `DeleteStudentFromTeamByIdCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰Delete student from team based on specified student id from a tutorial team.
- `DeleteStudentFromTeamByIndexCommand`â€‰â€” Delete student from team based on specifiedâ€‰index (viewable from the UI) from a tutorial team.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Example: `/delete_student_from_team id/A01234567X module/CS2103T tutorial/T09 team/4`

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteStudentFromTeamSequence.puml" alt="DeleteStudentFromTeamSequence" />

Step 1. The user executes `/delete_student_from_team id/A01234567X module/CS2103T tutorial/T09 team/4` command to delete the particular student with id `A01234567X` from the module `CS2103T` and tutorial class `T09` and team `4`.
The `execute` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which extracts the command word of the command and the arguments of the command.

Step 2. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a new `DeleteStudentFromTeamCommandParser` and calls `DeleteStudentFromTeamCommandParser#parse()`, with `id/A01234567X`, `module/CS2103T`, `tutorial/T09` and `team/4` as the arguments.

Step 3. The `DeleteStudentFromTeamCommandParser` parses the arguments to determine what parameter is used to specify the target student (email, index or id). Additionally, the `ModuleCode`, `TutorialClass` and `Team` is determined.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important Note:** The tutorial class, module code and team must be specified. To determine the target student, only one prefix should be used per command. If there are multiple prefixes, the target priority is as follows: By Index -> By Student ID -> By Email

</box>

Step 4. Based on the prefix used, `DeleteStudentFromTeamCommandParser` creates the specific `DeleteStudentFromTeamCommand` accordingly. Each command contains a specific predicate to find the student.

Step 5. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteStudentFromTeamCommand#execute()`, passing `Model` as an argument. This method retrieves the target module, tutorial class and team. Then, the method retrieves the student to delete using the defined predicate. Throughout the process, error handling (e.g. checking for invalid student/module/tutorial/team) is utilised to mitigate potential discrepancies and ensure valid execution.

Step 6. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created and the student is deleted from the team.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Modularity and extensibility:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Seperate each specific command into a different class, while overlapping code is abstracted to an abstract class.
  - Pros: Specific commands are instantiated and thus can be easily traced and is more readable. Any reusable code is defined in the abstract class which can then be reused by the subclasses.
  - Cons: May have duplicate code to a certain extent.

* **Alternative 2:** Lump into one generic command that handles each parameter accordingly.
  - Pros: Reduces duplicate code and much cleaner (i.e only 1 command class is executed).
  - Cons: The logic handling may be slightly more complex and messy within the class as all parameters have to be dealt with seperately (potentially using different logic).

### Allocating a student to a team in tutorial class.

1. Allocating a student to a team in the tutorial class by studentId, email or index that they belong to in the tutorial class list.

   1. Prerequisites:

      1. The student (Person's object) should already been in the module's tutorial class list of students.
      2. The module and tutorial class in that module must already exist in the system.
      3. The team to allocate the student into must exist in that tutorial class.
      4. The student to allocate must already exist in TAHelper system.

   2. To set up these prerequisites: visit [] to add student into tutorial class, and visit [] to add tutorial team into the tutorial class.

   3. Test case 1 (Allocating by student id): `/allocate_team id/A9876543A module/CS2101 tutorial/T02 team/Team1`
      Expected: Student successfully added to Team1 of tutorial T02.

   4. Test case 2 (Allocating by email) (Assuming Test case 1 is not executed on the same person): `/allocate_team email/Jared@example.com module/CS2101 tutorial/T02 team/Team1`
      Expected: Student successfully added to Team1 of tutorial T02.

   5. Test case 3 (Allocating a student that is not in that tutorial group): `/allocate_team id/A1111111Z module/CS2101 tutorial/T02 team/Team1`
      Expected: An error message is displayed indicating that the student needs to be in the tutorial group first.

   6. Test case 4 (Allocating a student that is not in the TAHelper system): `/allocate_team id/A0987654A module/CS2101 tutorial/T02 team/Team1`
      Expected: An error message is played indicating that the student is not in TAHelper system.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

## Planned Enhancements

Team size: 5

### 1. Include command to delete all classes from a specified module

**Current implementation**

1. Currently, there is no way to delete all classes from a specified module quickly, as we have to delete them one by one. For example, we can have a `/delete_all_classes module/MODULE` command.

**Proposed enhancement(s)**

1. A `/delete_all_classes` command could be implemented to help support this feature. This is different from `/delete_module` as this command deletes the module itself too, but `/delete_all_classes` would leave the module itself intact.

---

### 2. Support for more tutorial class name formats

**Current implementation**

1. Currently, our system only supports tutorial class names with 1 letter followed by 2 digits (e.g. `T01`). This could result in errors when trying to use a valid tutorial class name (such as `DTk1234`'s `TO43` or `CS2101`'s `SG15`)

**Proposed enhancement(s)**

1. Support as many types of tutorial class name types as possible, especially the more common ones.
   <br> Examples: 2 letters + 2 digits (e.g. `TO43`), 1 letter + 1 digit (e.g. `T5`)

---

### 3. Regular expression (regex) validation improvements

**Current implementation**

1. Currently, the name class employs a slightly less strict regular expression in order to validate the name that users input when adding a new Person. This means that currently, the system accepts a Person's name that is solely consisting of integers.
   which in most cases, is not culturally accepted or possible in the world. Furthermore, it does not support names with higher complexity such as "Jai S/O John". However, such names are perfectly acceptable formats and such formats appear in many names in Singapore and around the world.
2. Likewise, the email class employs a slightly less strict regular expression in order to validate the email that users input when adding a new Person. This means that user are able to input email format that is not a valid email by convention.
   Current implementation only mainly checks if the `@` symbol is present, and does not check if a valid domain has been entered.

**Proposed enhancement(s)**

1. We look to implement a stricter validation regular expression (regex) for the name valid value so that the system is able to accept names that have special symbols in them. Furthermore, we also want to implement a regex expression that ensures that a Person's name cannot solely contain all integer values.
2. We look to implement a stricter validation regular expression (regex) for the email valid value so that the system is only able to accept email values that are more appropriate and valid in terms of real world context.
   This enhancements could come in the form of ensure that a valid domain name has been passed in, as well as ensuring that the `.com` format for the wider public or the `u.nus.edu.sg` format for example, is specified in the context of NUS students.

---

### 4. More concise, detailed and descriptive error messages

**Current implementation**
There are many instances where the error messages have confused users. For example,

1. Currently, when a user tries to add a student with the same email or student id as any student in the system, the system will display a generic error message that tells user the person they want to add already exist in the system.
2. Currently, the error message when the /allocate_team is ran with an invalid command format is "Invalid command format!
   /allocate_team: Allocates a student a team in the tutorial class". However, this does not indicate to users which part of the command format is incorrect or invalid, potentially making it difficult for users to identify the part of the command where they have input wrongly.
   However, it does not tell users which value, email or student id, clashes with another Person object in the system.
3. Currently, the error message when the /random_teams is run with a module or tutorial class that does not exist is "Please check if you have entered an existing module and tutorial". However, this does not indicate to users whether module or tutorial does not exist in the system, which may potentially make it more difficult for users to identify whether it is module or class which does not exist.
4. When handling teams, the error message might append `Team` before the team name, which might confuse the user on whether the team name is `1` or `Team 1`, for example.

**Proposed enhancement(s)**

1. We look to implement a more detailed error message that specifies which field, email or id, or both, that violated the unique valid policy of a person object in the system. This way, it will improve user experience as users are able to fix the issue with more specific aid/help.
2. We look to implement a more descriptive error message that tells user which part of the AllocateStudentToTeamCommand that cause the command to be invalid. This way users can adapt to the invalid input and correct it quickly, which improves user experience.
3. We look to implement a more descriptive error message that tells user exactly whether module or tutorial class does not exist. This way users can adapt to the input values and correct it quickly, which improves user experience.
4. We will also make the error messages more clear in highlighting the 'true' team name.

---

### 5. Add column labels on UI to improve readability.

**Current implementation**

1. Current implementation for the columns does not show what the entries in the columns represent. Although we can safely assume that upon seeing the entries in each column, our target audience would be able to understand what the column means,
   but it can sometimes get confusing and overwhelming, especially for the last column, which handles the entries of students.

**Proposed enhancement(s)**

1. Firstly, we look to implement a label that tells users that the left column represents the list of modules, middle column represents the list of tutorial classes in that module,
   and the right column represents the list of students.
2. Secondly, we want to implement even more specific label, such as when user enters the module to view the list of classes for that module, the label for the middle column (the column displaying the list of tutorial classes) should show that something like
   'CS2101 tutorial classes', something that is specific to the module.
3. Thirdly, similar to point 2, we want to implement even more specific person column label, such as when user enters to view the list of students in a tutorial class, the label shows something like 'T01's class list'.
   This will greatly aid user's readability, and it is an enhancement we want to make.

---

### 6. Propagate students' edited information from EditCommand to other student lists

**Current implementation**

1. When editing a student's information using `/edit_student`, changes only appear on the list currently being displayed.
2. In order to sync a student information across modules, tutorial classes and teams, users would need to display the respective
   list in the UI and re-execute the command to make changes.
3. This can be an inconvenience and could lead to difficulties in keeping track of changes.

**Proposed enhancement(s)**

1. We look to improving the `/edit_student` command, such that it will propagate any changes made on a single student list to
   all other lists within the app. This allows for syncing of information across the different modules, tutorial classes and teams.

---

### 7. Improve the Random Allocation of students algorithm.

**Current implementation**

1. Current implementation only checks if the randomly selected tutorial team to add the student to is full before randomly selecting another one to add the student into.
   This can be a problem if the user wants to split the students into many teams (For example: user inputs 5 teams to split 16 people into.). What we might see is that sometimes, there might be a disproportionate number of people in one group.
   Where some groups might not even have students inside.

**Proposed enhancement(s)**

1. We will look into improving the random allocation algorithm, where the algorithm will allocate in batches, first batch ensuring that every team will have 1 member, next batch ensuring that they have 2 members, until the last batch where it will allocate the remaining students.
2. It will be random too as the people in the first batch will be randomly generated and then removed after being added, and so on.

---

### 8. Add custom exceptions

**Current implementation**

1. When an error occurs, the command will return a generic command exception along with the specified error message. However, this can potentially pose several problems:<br>
    a. **Lack of specificity**: It is difficult to determine the nature and cause of the encountered issue, aside from relying on the error message. This makes it challenging to accurately diagnose, leading to longer troubleshooting times.<br>
    b. **Difficulty in error identification**: Without distinct error types, it becomes difficult to classify and identify different types of errors.<br>
    c. **Limited error handling capabilities**: A generic command exception approach may not adequately support specialised error handling, such as conditional error handling based on error types. Having a wider range of error handling for different types can help with flexibility.

**Proposed enhancement(s)**

1. We will introduce custom exceptions tailored to specific error scenarios, allowing for more precise identification and error handling.
2. By doing so, we can potentially add custom error handling depending on the type of error thrown too, making the system more flexible and robust.

---

### 9. Seed command for generating sample data

**Current implementation**

1. Currently, there is no seed command implemented. Developers/end-users are required to manually create sample data for testing or initialisation purposes. This approach can be time-consuming and error-prone

**Proposed enhancement(s)**

1. We will introduce a seed command to initialise sample data. By executing the seed command, developers/users can populate the database with mock students, modules, tutorials and teams. This automated approach will not only save time but aslo reduce the likelihood of errors. Clear documentation and usage guidelines will accompany the seed command too.
